 Assignment 1 INFR 1020U-001
- Requirements:
 - Simple Platformer with a goal:
   - Build a simple "get to the end of the level” game that has an appropriate trigger when the player completes the level requirements.
- Physics
  - Must utilize Gravity
  - Must demonstrate 2 different types of movement control (i.e. physics-based and direct-control)
  - Implement 2 Speed Graphs for your main character,
    - See the images below that shows how the speed of the character should change over time. 
    - Ensure that your character moves according to these 2 graphs when you toggle them (GUI toggle)
    - Add a toggle to output the current position and time in a manner that can be easily graphed in Google Sheets to verify that your character moves with the same speed profile.
 - Must contain Sprites and Sprite Animations
 - **BONUS:**
   - add moving platforms/enemies
 - Things to hand in:
   - .zip file containing the Code, .exe. and all associated files so I and the TA can compile it.  Make sure it contains a .exe that runs as well.
   - Video of the gameplay with them talking over it and explaining how the code works (i.e. code walkthrough)
     - Demonstrate how you have achieved the speed/time graph with your character movement and explain which one feels best for your platformer (and why)
